## Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Swapnanil Dhol and I'm an Senior iOS Engineer at Loyalty Juggernaut (LJI). Over the past few years, I have been recognized as a three-time WWDC scholar, earning this prestigious award in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In 2020, I was also selected to participate in the Google Summer of Code program, working on an open source project with VideoLAN. I have been featured as a developer on the app store and am proud to have contributed to the creation of eight successful apps. As an open source enthusiast, I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with others in the development community. My GitHub bio showcases my skills and achievements, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and continue to grow as a developer. You can find me on the internet at these places:
